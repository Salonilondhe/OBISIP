I recently completed a rewarding one-month internship at Oasis InfoByte, where I significantly enhanced my web development skills. Throughout this experience, I tackled two key projects that provided me with hands-on experience in coding, problem-solving, and collaborating with a dynamic team. This internship not only deepened my technical knowledge but also allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, ultimately boosting my confidence and proficiency in web development.
